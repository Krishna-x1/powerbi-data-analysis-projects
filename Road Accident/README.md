🚦 Road Accident Analysis | Power BI Dashboard
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing road accident and casualty data to identify patterns, high-risk factors, and trends that can support data-driven road safety decisions.
The insights are presented through an interactive Power BI dashboard that highlights accident severity, vehicle involvement, road conditions, and location-based trends.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze current year road accidents and casualties

Compare current year vs previous year trends

Identify high-risk vehicle types and road types

Understand accident distribution by:

Urban vs Rural areas

Day vs Night conditions

Road surface and weather conditions

Visualize geographic accident hotspots
