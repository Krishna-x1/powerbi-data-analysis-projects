This repository showcases a collection of Power BI Data Analysis Dashboards built to demonstrate data modeling, visualization, and business insight generation skills using Microsoft Power BI.
Each project explores a real-world dataset and transforms it into an interactive, insight-driven dashboard powered by relationships, DAX measures, and visual storytelling.

Through these projects, I’ve practiced the complete BI workflow — from data cleaning and transformation to dashboard design and insight communication, using Power BI’s capabilities to turn raw data into clear business intelligence.
